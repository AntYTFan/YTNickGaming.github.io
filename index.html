    Nick Gaming is mostly about gaming.
    Although I may do a mystery video totally not about unboxing!<br>

    Hey Everyone! <br>
    So I just got a camera and tripod and I figured I use that to record my YouTube videos. Just recently I have been using it for YT videos. If you have been watching my recent videos you see that the video quality and audio quality has improved greatly. If you like the better video and audio quality then like my videos!

    <h2>How I Learned HTML and CSS</h2>
    <p>Hey Guys. You may be wondering, "How does this YouTuber know HTML and CSS?". Well, the answer is is that I used Khan Academy! If you type khanacademy.org onto your browser, it will direct you to a webpage! You have to create an account
         to start learning on KA(Khan Academy). Then, if you have an account, go to courses and click it. You will have tons of stuff. You will see something called computer proggraming.
         Next, if you actually see it, click it and it will give you  a lot of mini courses. Please do not skip any of the lessons if they are too hard! Keep reading the tutorial on it 
         and keep trying!
         So, if you want to learn proggraming, then go to KA(Khan Academy) and create an account and start learning!
